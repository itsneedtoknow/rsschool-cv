### About me

I’m 35 years old and…yes I’m in constant search of interests. I have experience in working as an administrative assistant. My priority for a job of my dream is plenty of interest in it, possibility to step forward little by little, possibility to see results of my work. Currently I work as a content manager, and it’s a small step towards to implementing my knowledge of html/css in real life.
